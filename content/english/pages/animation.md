#### Protect the ocean

Design concept

The character serves as the core of the design, symbolizing the close connection between humans and the ocean. The interior of the outline is filled with Marine life, implying the indivisibility of human life and Marine ecology. The combination of whales, dolphins, fish, seaweed and other diverse Marine life shows the rich diversity and complexity of the Marine ecosystem. The creatures are predominantly blue in color, emphasizing the vastness and depth of the ocean. “Where did my home go?” This thought-provoking text implies that Marine life is facing a crisis of survival due to human activities, and inspires people to pay attention to and think about Marine protection issues.

#### Silk Road

Design concept

My idea is to make an animated video to introduce the exchange of goods along the Silk Road and let more people know about the Silk Road. As we all know, the main means of transportation on the Silk Road was camels, so the camel was the center, and then a merchant took the traditional Chinese crafts, such as ceramics, silk, tea and so on, to exchange them and combine them.

By telling stories and providing relevant and important information, the whole process is wrapped around to introduce and understand this important route to all.
